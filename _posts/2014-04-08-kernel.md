Notes about building a custom Linux kernel,
building modules, and submitting patches.

Getting The Kernel Sources
--------------------------

    git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git
    cd linux-stable/

To list all the tags.

    git tag -l | less

Configuring the Kernel
----------------------

Configuration is necessary before modules or the kernel can built.

To use a previous config it can be copied (using from /boot) in
to the root of the Linux source tree as `.config`.
Then oldconfig can be run to configure any new options.

    cp /boot/config-`uname -r` .config
    make oldconfig

`make oldconfig` will prompt for each option.
To just say yes to everything use the `yes` program.

    yes "" | make oldconfig

Alternatively, to create a new configuration menuconfig or nconfig can be used.

    make menuconfig

or

    make nconfig

Once configuration is complete it should be prepared.

    make prepare

Now it should be possible to build the kernel and/or modules.

Building the Kernel and/or Modules
----------------------------------

To build everything simply type make.

    make

To take advantage of multiple processors the `-j` option can be used

    make -jX

where X is the number of processors.

It is also possible to build just a portion of the project by
using the M= option.  This is useful when building drivers.

    make M=scripts
    make M=drivers/staging/comedi/drivers

Generating a Patch
------------------

Make your own branch for your own changes.

    git branch newfeature
    git checkout mnewfeature

After changes have been made it should be built.

    make M=drivers/staging/comedi/drivers

It should be checked for any style warnings and all
problems should be fixed [[6],[7]].

    ./scripts/checkpatch.pl --file drivers/staging/comedi/drivers/ssv_dnp.c

When the changes are complete, make a commit.
A 'Signed-off-by:' entry can be added to the message with your own
name and email address.

    git commit

Changes are shared using patches.  The `format-patch` command is used
to prepare a patch to be emailed.

    git format-patch origin

This will result in a new patch.

    0001-my-first-patch.patch

Check the patch for any style or formatting problems.

    ./scripts/checkpatch.pl 0001-my-first-patch.patch

Next, it is necessary to determine who to send the patch to.
The get_maintainer.pl script can be used to find all the relevant
people.

    ./scripts/get_maintainer.pl 0001-my-first-patch.patch

This script can also be used directly on a file.

    ./scripts/get_maintainer.pl --file drivers/staging/comedi/drivers/ssv_dnp.c

Finally, the patch can be sent.

    git send-email --to jmmahler@gmail.com --cc linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org 0001-my-first-patch.patch

If there are multiple patches, additional steps may be necessary to
properly describe the order [[6]].

Need Something TODO?
---------------------

    find ./ -name TODO
