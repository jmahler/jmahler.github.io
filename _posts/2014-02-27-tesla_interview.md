I introduced myself to Tesla Motors by attending a job
fair they had at their plant in Fremont.
The event was an absolute mad house.
There were people everywhere and it was very loud
so conversations were difficult.
But I did manage to get my resume out to six firmware related
teams that looked interesting.

Whether this environment is conducive for finding good employees
is debateable.

Besides getting to meet the teams, one of the highlights
of the job fair was getting to see a Model S and a Roadster up close.
They were both parked at the entrance and unlocked so anyone could
anyone could tinker with them.  What surprised me the most about the
Model S was the lack of mechanical buttons on the console.  Nearly
everything is integrated in to the center display.  There is no
parking brake button or handle, for example. It is in a menu on
the center console.  I imagine other manufacturers, which have had
recalls due to their faulty mechanical switches, would have loved
to just do a software update.

Almost a month later I was contacted by a recruiter.
He was trying to fill a position for a firmware test engineer.
The first step was to speak with the recruiter by phone.
The conversation was fairly general: about the position,
why I want to work for Tesla.

The next step was to take a timed test that recruiter sends by email.
The questions were fairly basic.  Voltage dividers, capacitors,
test plans, some C programming.
They say they only allow 30 minutes for the test but I took longer
because I wanted to make sure the answers to be correct.

After this stage I interviewed with the manager of the team.
It was a general conversation about the company and he manages.
I liked that they use a flat management structure
where it is easy to contact others and resolve problems.
I also liked that he is an Engineer and knows the technical details
of these cars very well.  I also got to ask him some technical
questions about the Model S such as why it has two calipers on the
rear wheels (one is for the parking brake).

After this they set up an interview with one of the engineers on the team.
This interview was half technical questions.
Questions such as: what is a memory leak, what is the purpose of the volatile,
and other C programming questions.
It is fun just getting to know these people and to learn about what
goes on in Tesla.

At this point I had done well enough that they decided to bring me
in for an on cite interview.
The format consists of a 15 minute presentation at the beginning and
then one on one 45 minute interviews with three engineers and two managers.

This interview format is similar to what is described in the book
Peopleware by Tom DeMarco.
By involving the team in the decision process they share the
responsibility for the success of that candidate.
Also, a person chosen by the team is much more likely to "gel" with
the current team.

I arrived at the Palo Alto office for my on cite interview a few
minutes early and had to wait in the lobby.
It was around noon and there were lots of employees coming and going
since this was the main entrance to the building.
On a back wall there was TV screen with live supercharger statistics
from across the U.S.  And I could hear the receptionist taking calls.
Several calls were from people demanding to speak with Elon Musk,
which I found amusing.

The on cite interview was stressful but fun.
It was obvious that the engineers interviewing me were top notch.
One engineer even drilled me with technical questions while
simultaneously working on his phone.
But they were all very nice and fun to chat with.

I do all my coding in Vim.
It allows me to quickly move chunks of code around and format everything
so it is easy to read and understand.
And since the compiler is right there as well I can quickly
check for syntax errors and write tests.
Unfortunately, none of these tools I have come to depend upon were
available because all the coding questions had to be done on a white
board.
As a result, problems which I should have dominated,
became messy and hard to understand.

One thing that I found curious was why the technical questions
were fairly basic.  Certainly one reason is to filter out the dunces.
But even in the on cite interview the questions were relatively basic.
I later realized that it is possible to judge someones skill based
upon how quickly they can answer an easy question.
A person who can solve an easy problem as fast as they can write
is much more likely to be good at the hard problems.

The highlight of my on cite interview was the tour.
I wish I would have asked more questions but I was a bit in
awe of the whole operation.
Imagine a giant room full of a thousand people working in their cubicles.
But none of the cubicles have walls, they are just desks.
And every desk is covered with half torn apart control modules,
wiring, test equipment, and all sorts of other stuff.
Every part of the Model S is half torn apart somewhere in this room
and someone is diligently working on it.
It is a car hackers wonderland.

A week after the interview I got an email saying that I wasn't selected.
For whatever reason I wasn't the perfect candidate.
Nonetheless, it was a great experience.
Considering I haven't graduated college yet and this was the
first interview I had from the first place I applied to I think
I did pretty good.  Hopefully they will want someone like me
after graduation.

It is hard to believe that someone like me, with an automotive background
, extensive Linux experience and a degree in Electrical Engineering,
is not a good fit for Tesla.  Perhaps it is just an unfortunate result
that the interview did not reveal what a good candidate I believe I am.

It should have been a no brainer to hire someone like me.
