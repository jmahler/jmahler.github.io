I introduced myself to Tesla Motors by attending a job
fair they had at their plant in Fremont.
The event was an absolute mad house.
Wall to wall people.
And it was very loud and nearly impossible to hear anyone.
But I got my resume out to six firmware related teams.
And it was fun getting to see the technology up close.

A few weeks went by and then I was contacted by a recruiter
that was trying to fill a position for a firmware test engineer.
I guess someone noticed my resume!

The first step was to a basic interview with the recruiter.
Then I took a technical test.
The questions were fairly basic.  Voltage dividers, capacitors,
test plans, some C programming.
They say they only allow 30 minutes but I took longer because I
wanted my answers to be perfect.

After this stage I interviewed with the manager of the team.
Most just a conversation about what they do and how they manage.

Then they set up an interview with one of the engineers on the team.
This interview was probably half technical questions and half
chit chat.
What is a memory leak, what is the purpose of the volatile, and
other C programming questions.
It is fun just getting to know these people and to learn about what
goes on in Tesla.

At this point they decided to bring me in for an on cite interview.
The format consists of a 15 minute presentation about a technical
challenge that I faced and how I overcame that challenge.
And then I had one on one interviews with five of the engineers on
the team.

I arrived at the Palo Alto office early and had to wait for a few minutes.
There were lots of people coming and going.  On a back wall there was
TV screen with live supercharger statistics from across the U.S.
And I could hear the receptionist taking calls.  Several calls were
from people demanding to speak with Elon Musk, which I found amusing.

This interview format is straight out of the book, Peopleware, by Tom DeMarco.
Involving the team members in the hiring process makes them partially
responsible for the success/failure of a new candidate.
And this helps to find someone who will "gel" with the current team.
If you haven't read Peopleware, I highly recommend it.
It goes in to these topics in lots of detail.
And Tesla seems to employ a lot of their recommendations.

The on cite interview was stressful but in a fun way.
It was obvious that the engineers interviewing me were top notch.
One engineer even drilled me with technical questions while
simultaneously working on his phone.
But they were all very nice and fun to chat with.
There were quite a few questions which involved constructing a C program
on a white board.
I was somewhat lacking in this area because I was accustomed to my
keyboard.
So be sure to bring your laptop with you!
I would have destroyed every programming question they had
if I had brought my laptop.

The highlight of my on cite interview was the tour.
I wish I would have asked more questions but I was a bit in
awe of the whole operation.
Imagine a giant room full of a thousand cubicles.
And none of the cubicles have walls.
And every desk is covered with half torn apart control modules,
wiring, test equipment, and all sorts of other stuff.
Basically every part of the Model-S is half torn apart somewhere
in this room and someone is working on it.
And everyone seems very intent and focused on their work.
It is a car hackers wonderland.

A week after the interview I got an email saying that I wasn't selected.
For whatever reason I wasn't the perfect candidate at that time.
But I am optimistic that something will open up as I get closer to graduation.

Nonetheless it was a great experience.  Considering
I haven't graduated college yet and this is the first place I applied
to and my first interview, I think I did pretty good.
