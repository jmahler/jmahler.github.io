# Introduction

This is a collection of questions that I have been asked,
and that have been asked of me, during job interviews.
The technical questions are mostly related to
Electrical Engineering and Programming.

# From Managers

1. Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

1. Do you have any questions for me?

# For Managers

1. If you could implement a change which would significantly increase
productivity of your employees but which would also reduce the control
you have over them, would you do it?

1. I have read several books related to managing projects which align
with my idea of an ideal workplace.  Tell me if you have read any of
the following:

	1. Peopleware by Tom DeMarco
	1. Drive by Daniel Pink
	1. Getting Things Done by David Allen
	1. The Mythical Man Month by Frederick P. Brooks

1. Suppose I could introduce a technology which would reduce the development
time of a project from 6 months to 1 month while also increasing its
performance by several orders of magnitude.
While this solution satisfies all of the customers functional requirements,
it uses a technology that was not agreed upon.
Would you allow the new technology or continue with the old?

1. Your company uses Linux and other open source software.
What does it contribute back to the community?

# From Electrical Engineers, Programmers

1. What is your favorite programming language?

1. What is a memory leak?

1. Tell me about a challenging problem that kept you up late at night.

1. Why did you choose Electrical Engineering?

# For Electrical Engineers, Programmers

1. Have you ever written good quality C code that used a goto statement?

1. What surprised you the most about working here that you did
not anticipate before you were hired?
