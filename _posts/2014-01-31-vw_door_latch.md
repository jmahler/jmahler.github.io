The front door latch found on 1999 to 2005 (Mk4) Volkswagen Jettas, Golfs
and Beetles is a common failure item.
Typically, when they fail, they behave as if the door is always
open or always closed.
And in some cases this failure is sporadic.

There are several goals of this document:

1.  Determine the root cause of failure.
1.  Describe its operation (electrical switches).
1.  Devise absolutely certain method of diagnosis.
