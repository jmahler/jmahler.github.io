Introduction
============

Many projects use a development process similar to what has been
developed by Linus Torvalds and others for the Linux kernel
Projects such as: Linux[[1]], Git[[2]] and Subsurface[[3]].

These projects share some common characteristics.  All patches are sent
to a public mailing list and undergo a review process before being
accepted.  There is usually one person in control of the official
repository who decides which patches to accept.  The community is
typically very positive.  However they do not like wasting time.
Patches must be correctly prepared to ensure they are as easy to accept
as possible.  And Git is the primary tool for managing patches and
projects.

This is a collection of "tips and tricks" I have collected while working
on these projects.

Patch Size
==========

A patch should be as small as possible so it can be easily reviewed.
But it must not be so small that it is incomplete.  The application
of every patch in a series must keep the project in a working state.

Imagine trying to bisect a patch series where each patch left the
project in a broken state.  It would be a pain to say the least.

Suppose a patch series was created and you wanted to run the test suite
on each patch in turn.  One way is to use git rebase [[6]].

    GIT_EDITOR='sed -i "/^pick .*/aexec make -j8 test"' git rebase -i
