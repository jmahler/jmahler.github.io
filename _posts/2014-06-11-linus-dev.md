Introduction
============

Many projects use a development process similar to what has been
developed by Linus Torvalds and others for the Linux kernel
Projects such as: Linux[[1]], Git[[2]] and Subsurface[[3]].

These projects share some common characteristics.  All patches are sent
to a public mailing list and undergo a review process before being
accepted.  There is usually one person in control of the official
repository who decides which patches to accept.  The community is
typically very positive.  However they do not like wasting time.
Patches must be correctly prepared to ensure they are as easy to accept
as possible.  And Git is the primary tool for managing patches and
projects.

This is a collection of "tips and tricks" I have collected while working
on these projects.


Typical Workflow
================

    (make some changes)
    git commit -F log.txt --signoff
    git format-patch --cover-letter --reroll-count=2 -1
    (edit the cover letter)
    git send-email --to foo@bar.com --cc foo2@bar.com v2-0*

Formatting Patches
==================

Before commits can be sent in an email they need to be formatted.
The `git format-patch` command is used to do this.
It will produce a patch in mbox format for use with `git send-email`
which will be discussed later.

    git format-patch -1     # last change
    git format-patch -2     # last 2 changes

    git format-patch --cover-letter -1      # add a cover letter

    git format-patch --reroll-count=2 -1    # version 2

    git format-patch --signoff -1           # add a Signed-off-by
    * Note: --signoff can also be added during a commit

    git format-patch --signoff -1           # add a Signed-off-by

Patch Size
==========

A patch should be as small as possible so it can be easily reviewed.
But it must not be so small that it is incomplete.  The application
of every patch in a series must keep the project in a working state.
Imagine trying to bisect a patch series where each patch left the
project in a broken state.  It would be a pain to say the least.

Suppose a patch series was created and you wanted to run the test suite
on each patch in turn.  One way is to use git rebase [[6]].

    GIT_EDITOR='sed -i "/^pick .*/aexec make -j8 test"' git rebase -i

Cover Letter
============

It is helpful to add a cover letter than gives an introduction to the
patch series.  It should also describe what has been done in previous
versions.  It can also give links to the relevant conversations.

Changes in v2:
  - changed strnncmp to use strncmp instead of memcmp

Changes in v3:
  - changed strnncmp to use memcmp instead of strncmp

Reply To Revisions
==================

Often a patch will be submitted.  Then others will comment on it.
And then revised patches will be submitted.  It is important to keep
this discussion as linear and coherent as possible.  Imagine if they
joined the conversation at revision 8, could they easily lookup the
previous discissuion?

One way to do this is to have each to patch revision start a new subject
but provide links to the previous discussions on a mailing list.

    Version 3 of the patch series to cleanup duplicate name_compare()
    functions (previously was 'add strnncmp() function' [1]).

Another more advanced way is to make the new patch revision a reply to the
previous by using the "Message-id".  The first step is to find the
message id in the email headers.

    ...
    Subject: [PATCH 1/2] fixed commit
    Date: Sun, 22 Jun 2014 08:01:44 -0700
    Message-Id: <1403449304-551-1-git-send-email-jmmahler@gmail.com>
    X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.0.0
    ...

Next, the `--in-reply-to` option is used with `send-email`.  Be sure to
quote the id or else the shell might mis-interpret the meaning.

    git send-email \
      --in-reply-to="<1403449304-551-1-git-send-email-jmmahler@gmail.com>" \
      --to=jmm 0002-added-.gitignore.patch

Now the discussion of an entire patch series can be done in one thread
with no breaks.
